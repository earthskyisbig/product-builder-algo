# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A simple and visually appealing web application that allows users to generate unique sets of lottery numbers. The application will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web standards and design principles.

## Features & Design

### Core Functionality
- **Generate Numbers:** A user can click a button to generate a set of 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
- **Display Numbers:** The generated numbers are displayed clearly on the screen.

### Visual Design
- **Theme:** A modern and clean design with a playful feel.
- **Layout:** A centered, responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Colors:** A vibrant color palette will be used to distinguish the number balls, making the interface more intuitive and engaging.
- **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts will be used for all text elements.
- **Effects:** Subtle shadows and transitions will be used to create a sense of depth and interactivity.

## Current Plan

1.  **HTML (`index.html`):** Create the basic structure of the application, including a title, a container for the lottery numbers, and a "Generate" button.
2.  **CSS (`style.css`):** Style all the elements to create a polished and visually appealing user interface. This will include styling the number balls with different colors and adding responsive design rules.
3.  **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Implement the logic for generating unique, random lottery numbers when the user clicks the button and display them in the UI.
